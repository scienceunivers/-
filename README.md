# Preface

*This is at first a place for me to learn using github and understand how others are solving bugs and various problems in thier projects. Also I'm gonna make some repos to hold my  work which can easy my life.*

Codes in the repository may not be perfect, because it's tested in jupyter, some lines might not be enough to directly executed as a script. Due to some confidential regulations, some file information will be erased or covered.

This repo is mainly aimed to automate the weekly work for me about grading data that cooperation partners upload. In future I will try to renew the pieces involving excel formulas written in xlrd using openpyxl.
